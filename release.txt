Streamline SDK Public 2.0.0 Release Notes

Development Notes:
-- Note that to rebuild SL from source, you will need to download(/build) and install Slang and xxd.  See the Readme.md for details.

Changed Behavior and New Features:
-- With the release of SL 2.0.0, the DLSS-G plugin is being made available publicly for the first time.  Note that only precompiled binaries of the sl.dlss_g.dll plugin are available, not source.  However, source is available for the rest of the plugins and SL core.
-- SL 2.0.0 is a new major version of SL.  It is not backwards-compatible with earlier versions, and it is not compatible with apps integrated using earlier versions of SL.
-- There are significant API changes and improvements, especially for applications wishing to control the "hooking" of 3D API functions, the tagging of resources and the passing of parameters to plugins.

Transitioning from SL 1.x to SL 2.0.0 (High Level):
-- The new document, docs/APIChangesAndImprovements.md details major points in transitioning from older versions of SL to 2.0
